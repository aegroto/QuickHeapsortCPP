# QuickHeapsortCPP
Quick Heapsort implementation made in C++, work in progress.

## Compile under Linux
Compile with `g++ testutils.cpp main.cpp -o qhsort`, make it executable with `chmod +x qhsort` and execute using `./qhsort x y` where `x` is the number of testsand `y` is the array  size of each test.

## Compiler under Windows
Assuming you have MinGW, compile with `g++ testutils.cpp main.cpp -o qhsort.exe` and execute it with `qhsort.exe x y` where `x` is the number of tests and `y` is the array size of each test.
